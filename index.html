                    <p>Companies have noticed that the climate is changing because of the rise in extreme weather and sea
                        levels. This change is making it harder for traditional farming and creating a greater demand of
                        resources. Companies are already thinking about responses to this trend. For example, Coca-Cola sees
                        water scarcity in the future as a threat to its sustainability. This threat has caused Coca-Cola to initiate
                        an initiative to restore the US watershed by returning water to the National Forest System. Weather
                        changes and population growth both drive resource scarcity.</p>
